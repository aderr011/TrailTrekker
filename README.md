# TrailTrekker
This project is a web app that allows users to plan and embark on road trips and overland adventures while highlighting off-road trails and dispersed camping locations. The app is designed to be a one-stop-shop for users who want to explore the great outdoors without having to pay for hotels or other accommodations.

Users can search for off-road trails and dispersed camping locations based on their preferred route, location, or other criteria. The app provides detailed information about each trail and camping location, including maps, photos, user ratings, and reviews.

In addition to helping users find and plan their trips, the app also provides tools for organizing their itinerary, tracking their progress, and sharing their experiences with others. Users can create a custom route for their trip, add waypoints and activities, and get recommendations for nearby attractions and points of interest.

Overall, the app is designed to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for planning and embarking on road trips and overland adventures that emphasize off-road trails and dispersed camping.
